# DEFT: Social Media Use and Risk Taking

This repository contains the data and analysis scripts for two studies examining associations between social media use, cognitive traits (impulsivity, reward sensitivity, exploration), and risk‑taking subtypes. Each study is self‑contained and can be run independently.

**How To Use This Repository**
1. Open the study folder you need (`study-1` or `study-2`).
2. Read the study‑specific README for step‑by‑step instructions.
3. Run the numbered scripts in order. Output tables are created when the scripts run.

If you prefer a single command, each study includes a `scripts-analyses/run_all.R` file that runs every step in order.

This repository is organized for clarity and transparency so that each analysis can be reproduced directly from the included CSV data and scripts.
